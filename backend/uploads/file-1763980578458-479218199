Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is safety equipment workers wear to prevent injury when other safety measures are not enough.

Key Points about PPE:
• Employers must provide PPE at no cost to employees.
• If an employee uses their own PPE, the employer is responsible for ensuring it is adequate, maintained, and clean.
• Employers are generally not required to pay for non-specialty safety-toe footwear or prescription safety eyewear if these items can be worn off-site.

When PPE is Required:
PPE is needed when hazards like chemical, radiological, or mechanical irritants can cause injury through absorption, inhalation, or physical contact.

Common Types of PPE:
• Head protection
• Eye protection
• Face protection
• Hand protection
• Foot protection
• Body protection
• Hearing protection
• Respiratory protection

Specific Types of PPE:

Head Protection
• Needed for: Hazards like flying or falling objects, working near energized electrical equipment, or on construction sites.
• Types:
• Impact Protection: Type I (top impact), Type II (top and side impact).
• Electrical Protection: Class G (up to 2,200 volts), Class E (up to 20,000 volts), Class C (no electrical protection).
• How to Wear: Hard hats must fit properly, be worn squarely, and never be cocked at an angle or backwards.
• Care: Check for cracks, damage, or chalky appearance before each use. Replace as needed. Avoid storing in direct sunlight.

Eye Protection
• Needed for: Hazards that can cause eye injury from physical, chemical, or radiation agents (e.g., flying particles, chemicals, impacts, lasers, heat).
• Types: Non-prescription safety glasses, prescription safety glasses, and goggles (chemical, laser, welding). Chemical goggles offer stronger protection against impact, dust, and splashes.
• Care: Check for cracks or damage before each use. Replace as needed. Store in a clean area.

Face Protection
• Needed for: Hazards that can cause facial injury (e.g., splashes, flying objects, contents under pressure, electrical work).
• Types: Face shields, welding shields.
• How to Wear: Safety goggles or other eye protection *must* always be worn under a face shield.

Hand Protection
• Needed for: Hazards causing hand injury (e.g., harmful substances, sharp objects, chemical or thermal burns, extreme temperatures, electrical work).
• Types: Chemical resistant, puncture/cut/abrasion resistant, voltage rated, temperature resistant, infectious agent/biohazard resistant (e.g., latex, vinyl, nitrile gloves).
• Care: Check for cuts, cracks, or discoloration before each use. Replace as needed. Discard single-use gloves after use. Store in a clean area.

Foot Protection
• Needed for: Hazards causing foot injury (e.g., falling or rolling objects, piercing/cutting injuries, electrical work, chemical exposure).
• Types: Steel-toed, electrical resistant (marked "EH"), chemical resistant.
• Care: Check for cuts, cracks, or damage before each use. Keep electrical hazard shoes dry and free from conductive materials. Replace if soles are damaged. Replace chemical resistant shoes if discolored or damaged. Store in a clean, dry place.

Body Protection
• Needed for: Potential contamination or injury to legs, arms, back, or chest (e.g., heat, splashes, sharp objects, chemicals, radiation, electrical work).
• Types: Lab coats, aprons, chemical resistant sleeves, Tyvek suits, coveralls, arc flash rated clothing.

Hearing Protection
• Needed for: Areas where the average noise level reaches 90 decibels over an 8-hour period. Hearing protection must be available when noise reaches 85 decibels.
• Examples of High Noise Areas: Mechanical rooms, shops, construction sites, using power tools.
• Types: Ear plugs, ear muffs, canal caps.
• Wearing Ear Plugs: Roll the plug into a thin shape, pull your ear up and back, insert the plug, and hold it until it expands and seals.
• Care: Check for damage before each use. Replace if damaged. Store in a clean, dry place. Replace disposable ear plugs frequently.

Respiratory Protection
• Needed for: Inhalation hazards (e.g., working with uncontained or highly toxic chemicals, dusty environments, painting, welding).
• Types: Dust masks, half masks, full masks, Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR), Supplied Airline Respirators, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).

General PPE Cleaning, Care, and Maintenance:
• Cleaning: Keep PPE clean and sanitary. Use mild soap and water, or follow manufacturer instructions for special cleaning.
• Contamination: If PPE is contaminated and cannot be safely cleaned, it may require special disposal.
• Storage: Store PPE to prevent contamination (e.g., in plastic bags, lockers, drawers).
• Damage: Do not use damaged PPE. Employees must report damaged PPE to their supervisor immediately for replacement. Do not attempt to repair PPE.
